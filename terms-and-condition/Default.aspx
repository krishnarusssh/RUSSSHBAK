Should the materials or services prove defective, you, and not the company, shall assume the entire cost of all necessary servicing and repair. The company expressly disclaims all warranties of any kind, whether express, implied, or statutory, with respect to the company websites (including, but not limited to, any implied or statutory warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular use or purpose, title, and non-infringement of intellectual property rights).

The company makes no warranty as to the results that may be obtained from the use of the company websites or as to the accuracy or reliability of any information obtained through the company websites. No advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained by you through the company websites or from the company, its parents, subsidiaries, or other affiliated companies, or its or their suppliers (or the respective officers, directors, employees, or agents of any such entities) (collectively, "<strong>company parties</strong>") shall create any warranty. The company disclaims all equitable indemnities.</p>
                    <p>You understand and agree that any material or data downloaded or otherwise obtained through the company websites is done entirely at your own discretion and risk and you shall be solely responsible for any damage to your computer systems or loss of data that results from the download of such material or data.

                    <h3>Limitation of liability</h3>
                    <p>In no event will any of the company parties be liable for (a) any indirect, special, consequential, punitive, or exemplary damages or (b) any damages whatsoever in excess of indian rupees 10,00,000  (including, without limitation, those resulting from loss of revenues, lost profits, loss of goodwill, loss of use, loss of goods, business interruption, or other intangible losses), arising out of or in connection with the company websites (including, without limitation, use, inability to use, or the results of use of the company websites), whether such damages are based on warranty, contract, tort, statute, or any other legal theory and even if any company party has been advised (or should have known) of the possibility of such damages.</p>
                    <h3>Exclusions and limitations</h3>
                    <p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation or exclusion of liability for certain damages. Accordingly, some of the above disclaimers and limitations of liability may not apply to you. To the extent that any of the Company Parties may not, as a matter of applicable law, disclaim any implied warranty or limit its liabilities, the scope and duration of such warranty and the extent of such party’s liability shall be the minimum permitted under such applicable law.</p>
                    <h3>Other agreements; software, services or access</h3>
                    <p>The Company may provide products (such as hardware or software) services (such as hardware maintenance or repair or software maintenance, installation, or training) or access to the Company Websites under the terms of a separate agreement between you and the Company (each, an "<strong>Other Agreement</strong>"). The Company's obligations with respect to any product, service, or access that it makes available to you under any Other Agreement shall be governed solely by the Other Agreement under which such product or service is provided and these Terms and Conditions shall not be deemed or construed to alter the terms of such Other Agreements.</p>
                    <p>For example, the use of any software that is made available to download from the Company Websites ("<strong>Software</strong>") is governed by the terms of the end user license agreement, if any, which accompanies or is included with the Software ("<strong>License Agreement</strong>"). You may not install any Software that is accompanied by or includes a License Agreement unless you first have agreed to the License Agreement terms. If no end user license agreement accompanies or is included with the Software, then such Software shall be deemed to be Materials hereunder and these Terms and Conditions shall govern your use of such Software. Further reproduction or redistribution of any software is expressly prohibited, unless such reproduction or redistribution is expressly permitted by the license agreement accompanying or included with such software.</p>
                    <h3>General</h3>
                    <p>These Terms and Conditions, together with any additional terms to which you agree when using particular elements of the Company Websites, constitute the entire and exclusive and final statement of the agreement between you and the Company with respect to the subject matter hereof, superseding any prior agreements or negotiations between you and the Company with respect to such subject matter. The Company Parties are third party beneficiaries with respect to the provisions in these Terms and Conditions that reference them. These Terms and Conditions and the relationship between you and the Company shall be governed by the laws of India as applied to agreements made, entered into, and performed entirely in India, notwithstanding your actual place of residence. All disputes arising from or relating to these Terms and Conditions or your use of the Company Websites shall be brought in the courts of Mumbai, and you hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts for such purpose. The failure of the Company to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms and Conditions shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of these Terms and Conditions is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, you nevertheless agree that the court should endeavour to give effect to the intentions of the Company and you as reflected in the provision, and that the other provisions of these Terms and Conditions remain in full force and effect. The Clause titles in these Terms and Conditions are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. These Terms and Conditions shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding any termination of your use of the Company Websites. These Terms and Conditions will be interpreted without application of any strict construction in favour of or against you or the Company. These Terms and Conditions, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by the Company without restriction.</p>
                    <h3>Modifications to these Terms and Conditions</h3>
                    <p>The Company may, in its sole and absolute discretion, change these Terms and Conditions from time to time. The Company will post notice of such changes on the Website or the Software. If you object to any such changes, your sole recourse shall be to cease using the Company Websites. Continued use of the Company Websites following notice of any such changes shall indicate your acknowledgement of such changes and agreement to be bound by the terms and conditions of such changes. Certain provisions of these Terms and Conditions may be superseded by expressly-designated legal notices or terms located on particular pages of the Company Websites and, in such circumstances, the expressly-designated legal notice or term shall be deemed to be incorporated into these Terms and Conditions and to supersede the provision(s) of these Terms and Conditions that are designated as being superseded.</p>
